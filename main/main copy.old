\section*{Introduction}

Estimating the time varying reproduction number ($R_t$) is an important part of monitoring the progression of an epidemic, it informs short term projections of the epidemic size and hence guides decisions on policy interventions targetting behaviour. $R_t$ estimation may be done using a range of techniques with varying degrees of sophistication, but the majority are based on a time series of count data reflecting the incidence of infection in the population. Such count data may be new infections, hospitalisations or deaths, and are well known to exhibit specific biases due to incomplete ascertainment, reporting delay, and right truncation, along with more generic data quality issues such as missing values or anomalous values.

When correcting for such issues, one approach is to use count data to estimate incidence of a disease ($I_t$) using a model based around a time varying poisson rate, and fitted using maximum likelihood, using a logarithmic link function. In this common situation the estimate of the poisson rate at any given time point ($t$) is a log-normally distributed quantity defined by parameters $\mu_t$ and $\sigma_t$, which reflect the uncertainty in the data.

It is appealing to use such a modelled incidence estimate to calculate an estimate of the reproduction number, $R_t$. Incidence models can be derived in a number of ways, they are easily inspected for error and can be made tolerant of missing values and outliers.

This paper presents a mathematical approach to estimating the instantaneous reproduction number from modelled incidence data, which propagates incidence model uncertainty into estimates of the reproduction number. We validate this method against a simulation based on a branching process model with parameterised reproduction number and qualitatively compare the output to a reproduction number estimate using the Cori method implemented in the R package EpiEstim.

Supporting implementations of all methods described here are provided in the associated R package ``ggoutbreak'' (\url{https://ai4ci.github.io/ggoutbreak/}).

\section*{Materials and methods}


\subsection*{Mathematical analysis}

To use a modelled estimate of incidence to predict $R_t$ we
need to propagate uncertainty in incidence into our $R_t$ estimates. To
calculate $R_t$ we can use the backwards-looking renewal equations which
incorporate the infectivity profile of the disease ($\omega$) at a number of
days after infection ($\tau$):

\begin{eqnarray}
I_t \sim Poisson(\Lambda_t) \\
\Lambda_t \sim Lognormal(\mu_t,\sigma_t) \\
R_t = \frac{I_t}{\sum_{\tau}{\omega_{\tau}I_{t-\tau}}}
\end{eqnarray}

giving us:

\begin{eqnarray}
R_t \sim \frac{\Lambda_t}{\sum_{\tau}{\omega_{\tau}\Lambda_{t-\tau}}} \\
R_t \sim \frac{Lognormal(\mu_t,\sigma_t)}{\sum_{\tau}{
  Lognormal( \mu_{t-\tau} + log(\omega_{\tau}) , \sigma_{t-\tau})
}} \\
\end{eqnarray}


As an aside, it has been shown that the sum of log-normal distributions can be approximated by another log-normal (Lo 2013) with parameters $\mu_Z$ and $\sigma_Z$.

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{aligned}
	S_+ &= \operatorname{E}\left[\sum_i X_i \right] = \sum_i
	\operatorname{E}[X_i] =
	\sum_i e^{\mu_i + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_i^2}
	\\
	\sigma^2_{Z} &= \frac{1}{S_+^2} \, \sum_{i,j}
	  \operatorname{cor}_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j \operatorname{E}[X_i] \operatorname{E}[X_j] =
	  \frac{1}{S_+^2} \, \sum_{i,j}
	  \operatorname{cor}_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j e^{\mu_i+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_i^2}
	  e^{\mu_j+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_j^2}
	\\
	\mu_Z &= \ln\left( S_+ \right) - \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{Z}^2
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}

The sum term in the denominator of the renewal equation consists of a set of
correlated scaled log normal distributions with both scale and correlation
defined by the infectivity profile ($\omega$). In our case $cor_{ij}$ can be
equated to the infectivity profile ($\omega_{|i-j|}$) when $i \neq j$ and 1 when
$i = j$. $\mu_i$ is $\mu_{t-\tau} + ln(\omega_{\tau})$.


\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{aligned}
	S_{t} &= \sum_{s=1}^{|\omega|} { \omega_s e^{\mu_{t-s} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{t-s}^2 }} \\
	\sigma_{Z,t} &= \sqrt{
	  \frac{
	    \sum_{i,j=1}^{|\omega|} {
  	    (\omega_{|i-j|}+I(i,j)) \omega_i \omega_j (\sigma_{(t-i)} e^{\mu_{(t-i)}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{(t-i)}^2}) (\sigma_{(t-j)} e^{\mu_{(t-j)}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{(t-j)}^2})
	    }
	  }{S_{t}^2}
	}	\\
	\mu_{Z,t} &= \log\left( S_{t} \right) - \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{Z,t}^2
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}

$\mu$ is the central estimate of case counts on the log scale, and its standard
deviation can also be large. There are numerical stability issues dealing
with terms involving $e^{(\mu+\sigma^2)}$, however keeping everything in log space and
using optimised log-sum-exp functions this can be made computationally tractable.

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{aligned}
	\log(S_{t}) &= \log(\sum_{s=1}^{|\omega|} {  e^{\mu_{t-s} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{t-s}^2 + \log(\omega_s) }}) \\
	\log(T_{t,\tau}) &= \log(\omega_{\tau}) + \log(\sigma_{(t-{\tau})}) + \mu_{(t-{\tau})} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{(t-{\tau})}^2) \\
	\log(cor_{i,j}) &= \log(\omega_{|i-j|}+I(i=j)) \\
	\log(\sigma_{Z,t}^2) &= \log(
	    \sum_{i,j=1}^{|\omega|} {
  	      e^{
  	        \log(cor_{i,j}) + \log(T_{t,i}) + \log(T_{t,j})
  	      }
	    }) - 2 \log(S_{t}) \\
	\mu_{Z,t} &= \log( S_{t} ) - \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{Z,t}^2
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}

N.B. if we assume the individual estimates of the incidence are uncorrelated this
simplifies to:

\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{aligned}
\log(\sigma_{Z,t}^2) &= \log(
	    \sum_{\tau=1}^{|\omega|} {
  	      e^{
  	        2 \log(T_{t,\tau})
  	      }
	    }) - 2 \log(S_{t})
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}

Empirically there is not a huge amount of difference in estimates between these
two forms. If the infectivity profile $\omega$ is spread out over a large period
then the correlation matrix will be $O(\omega)^2$ which may predicate this simpler
order 1 formulation.

With $\mu_{Z,t}$ and $\sigma_{Z,t}$ we are left with the final derivation of
$R_t$, giving us a distributional form of $R_t$ incorporating uncertainty from
modelled incidence estimates:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:final}
\begin{aligned}
R_t &= \frac{Lognormal(\mu_t,\sigma_t)}
{Lognormal( \mu_{Z,t}, \sigma_{Z,t})} \\
\mu_{R_t} &= \mu_t - \mu_{Z,t} \\
\sigma_{R_t} &= \sqrt{\sigma_t^2+\sigma_{z,t}^2} \\
R_t &= Lognormal(\mu_{R_t}, \sigma_{R_t})
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}

This is conditioned on a single known infectivity profile. In reality there is
also uncertainty in the infectivity profile, however we cannot assume any
particular distributional form for this. We can use a range of empirical
estimates of the infectivity profile to calculate multiple distributional
estimates for $R_t$ and then combine these as a mixture distribution.

There is not much we can assume about this mixture distribution, as it will depend on the
nature of the various empirical infectivity profile distributions. However, we can
use general properties of mixture distributions to generate estimates for the
mean and variance of the reproduction number estimate including uncertaininty
arising from multiple infection profile estimates and from the incidence
estimate models ($R_t^*$):

$$
\begin{align}
E[R_t|\omega] &= e^{(\mu_{R_t,\omega} - \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{R_t,\omega}^2)} \\
V[R_t|\omega] &= \big[
  e^{(\sigma_{R_t,\omega}^2)} - 1
\big] \big[
  e^{2 \mu_{R_t,\omega} + \sigma_{R_t,\omega}^2}
\big] \\
E[R_t^*] &= \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} E[{R_t|\omega}] \\
V[R_t^*] &= \frac{1}{|\Omega|} \bigg(\sum_{\omega \in \Omega}{V[R_t|\omega]+E[R_t|\omega]^2}\bigg) - E[R_t^*]^2 \\
\end{align}
$$

The cumulative distribution function of the mixture is simply the arithmetic mean of the
component cumulative distribution functions (conditioned on each infectivity profile). If
$\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution:


$$
\begin{align}
F_{R_t^*}(x) &= \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\sum_{\omega \in \Omega}F_{R_t}(x|\omega) \\
P(R_t^* \le x) &= \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} P(R_{t,\omega} \le x) \\
P(R_t^* \le x) &= \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \Phi\bigg(\frac{ln(x) - \mu_{R_t,\omega}}{\sigma_{R_t,\omega}}\bigg)
\end{align}
$$

As the cumulative density function of this mixture distribution is a strictly
increasing function, specific solutions for median ($q_{0.5}$) and 95\% confidence intervals
($q_{0.025}$ and $q_{0.975}$) can be calculated numerically by solving the following equations:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \Phi\bigg(\frac{ln(q_{0.025}) - \mu_{R_t,\omega}}{\sigma_{R_t,\omega}}\bigg) - 0.025 &= 0 \\
\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \Phi\bigg(\frac{ln(q_{0.5}) - \mu_{R_t,\omega}}{\sigma_{R_t,\omega}}\bigg) - 0.5 &= 0 \\
\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \Phi\bigg(\frac{ln(q_{0.975}) - \mu_{R_t,\omega}}{\sigma_{R_t,\omega}}\bigg) - 0.975 &= 0
\end{align}
$$

In summary we present a method for retrieving the distributional form of the reproduction number from estimates of incidence arising from simple statistical count models, and including uncertainty arising from both count models and from infectivity profile distributions. This is fully deterministic and computationally inexpensive.

\subsection*{Validation}

To test this method we developed a simulation based on a branching process model parametrised by $R_t$, imported infections, and infectivity profile. Taken together, $R_t$ and the infectivity profile define the expected number of secondary infections given a primary infection, on each day post infection. This expectation is sampled using a Poisson distribution to realise simulated infections on each day. On average the degree of outward edges in the network of realised infections at any given time is a sample from the parametrised $R_t$ which we regard as the ground truth. This simulation generates a line list of synthetic infections, using various $R_t$ time series, but keeping infection importation, and infectivity profile constant. The line list of infected individuals were aggregated to daily counts of infection.

To assess the effect of random noise in the input data we assume that infections are subject to varying degrees of ascertainment which change from day to day. This daily rate of ascertainment is modelled as a Beta distributed quantity with a fixed mean, but variable standard deviation, ranging from low values representing homogenous day to day ascertainment, to high values with large day to day variation. Various ascertainment scenarios were applied to the same underlying infection time series, with observed counts being a binomial sample from the infection counts for a given day, with the daily varying probability of ascertainment. In this way all the simulations have the same underlying parametrisation, and only vary by the degree of statistical noise, which is proportional to the size of the infection count at any given time point.

 The resulting observed infection counts were used directly as an input to EpiEstim to generate a baseline $R_t$ estimate as a comparator. The synthetic infections are also used as input to estimate the underlying infection rate, using a simple statistical Poisson model with time varying rate parameter, represented by a piecewise polynomial, and fitted using maximum likelihood with a logarithmic link function according to the methods of Loader et al. The central estimate and the standard error of the fitted Poisson rate were then also used as inputs to the $R_t$ estimation method described in this paper. The posterior distributions of $R_t$ estimates from both modelled incidence method and from EpiEstim, were compared to simulation ground truth using the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the quantile bias, in the presence of increasing ascertainment noise. All simulations were repeated multiple times for each parametrised $R_t$ time series to identify if the performance of the two estimation frameworks was statistically different. We also collect and compare processing time for the two estimation frameworks (including incidence model fitting). In a sensitivity analysis we examined the effect on accuracy metrics of correcting for lag in EpiEstim estimates.

As a final part of the validation we took the simulated individuals and applied a probability that the individual experienced symptoms, accoring to a Bernouilli distribution. For those who experienced symptoms, we applied a time delay representing a time from infection to onset of symptoms, defined by a Gamma distribution. From the first 1000 infector-infectee pairs who both experienced symptoms we calculated a serial interval, which we used to estimate an empirical serial interval distribution. We then counted the symptomatic individuals for each day of symptom onset, to get a daily symptomatic case count. From symptomatic case counts we use the same Poisson model with time varying rate as above, to derive a model of incidence of symptomatic cases rather than infections. We then test the methods described in this paper with symptomatic case counts and serial interval distribution to derive an estimate of $R_t$, which we compared to the parametrised input to the simulation, using CRPS and quantile bias as before.

\section*{Results}

Testing this against the incidence model shown above, and comparing the results
to the SPI-M-O consensus $R_t$ estimates gives us the following time-series for
England. This has not been formally evaluated but qualitatively is a good fit. This
single time series with 1410 time points took around 3 seconds to fit, which opens
up the possibility of performing $R_t$ estimates in fine grained geographical
or demographic subgroups.

A qualitative comparison of instantaneous reproduction number estimates is shown. Row A shows three case timeseries based on a single run of a branching process model paramterised with a stepped reproduction number time series (red lines in panel B) and infectivity profile as in supplementary figures 1 and 2. Case counts are shown as dots and a smoothed estimate of the cases per day as a line with shaded 95\% confidence intervals. All three timeseries have on average 70\% case ascertainment, however the day to day variability of ascertainment is parameterised as a logistic normal random variable, with ``minimum'' representing no variability in daily rate of ascertainment, ``moderate'' represents a coefficience of variation of the daily ascertainment is 1, and ``high'' when the coefficient of variation is 2. Row B shows estimates of the reproduction number based on the methods presented in this paper, for each of the ``minimum'', ``moderate'' and ``high'' variability in timeseries. Row C shows the result of running EpiEstim on the same case counts. In rows B and C the parameterised $R_t$ is shown as a solid red line, and the red dots show the instantaneous $R_t$ value realised in this one specific simulation (and which can be regarded as the ground truth for this single simulation run.}
